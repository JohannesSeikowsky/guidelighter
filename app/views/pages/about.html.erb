  <p> Born in the Soviet Union, grew up in Germany, living in London. Working in finance, team-player, Karma-addict. Good at looking for 
  trouble, better at finding solutions. Guidelighter is a brain-child that has been growing in my mind for years. It sometimes only takes the smallest of efforts to help a person in a major way. Why don’t more people do it then? Helping starts in your day to day. Let’s hack helping and raise people’s awareness of how we can make each other’s lives easier! <br>

  <p>
    I'm a Co-Founder & CEO at Guidelighter and an Associate in the Healthcare M&A Team at Rothschild. I've worked for over four years advising corporates and private equity firms on M&A and capital markets transactions in the Healthcare and Industrials sectors at Rothschild and Citigroup. Having studied BSc. (Hons.) Accounting & Finance at the University of Warwick, I had a knack for entrepreneurship and started several businesses before which include: a presentation design & consultancy business, a mobile app focused on influencing savings and an online revision notes marketplace. I've mentored students and young professionals exploring career opportunities, looking to launch a start up, start a blog or share perspectives on the journey of becoming a better value investor.

    I'm the CTO of Guidelighter, the very page you are on right now. That means that I do all the programming and development work around here. Despite my role as CTO I have never set foot in a Computer Science lecture, which is something I simultaneously regret and am proud of. Instead my formal education is in Economics. I hold a Bachelor in "Economics and Management" from the University of Oxford. The stuff with computers I mostly taught myself through trial and error. Generally I have a wide range of interests and can pretty much be interested in anything as long as there's something to figure out. Right now I'm figuring out how to make Guidelighter great for you.

  <h2> Guidelighter - Why </h2>
   <p>
    When making career or university decisions, all you sometimes need is a chat with someone who has been there and has done it. You shouldn’t be in the position of not having anyone to ask such important questions. <br> <br> 

    Guidelighter is the easy way to talk to such a person. We are a marketplace for students, professionals and firms to offer their experience, coaching or any other form of career/university advice & help to those who need it right now. <br> <br>

    All of us have valuable experience that others could benefit from. Therefore on Guidelighter, everyone can become a guide and share their knowledge and experience peer to peer on their own terms and at whatever price they deem appropriate – or for free. <br> <br>

    Our goal is to make many more people share experience and many more people to access experience before making important life and career decisions. Everyone deserves their personal career guide and Guidelighter is here to give you one!"
