     I am the Co-Founder of Guidelighter. I studied Politics and International Relations at Royal Holloway (with an exchange year at the University of California, San Diego - yes, that was nice) followed by an MPhil in International Relations at the University of Oxford. <br> <br> Out of a post-graduation blues I found myself going into finance and first interned at Citigroup's Private Banking unit 
     and ultimately joined Citigroupâ€™s Corporate Banking group in London where I covered EMEA Corporates. After 3 years at Citi I made my corporate escape and finally, at Guidelighter, I am doing the thing I am really good at: helping others to improve and find their way in life.

      I'm the CTO of Guidelighter, the very page you are on right now. That means that I do all the programming and development work around here.Despite my role as CTO I have never set foot in a Computer Science lecture, which is something I simultaneously regret and am proud of. Instead my formal education is in Economics. I hold a BA in "Economics and Management" from the University of Oxford. The stuff with computers I mostly taught myself through trial and error. Generally I have a wide range of interests and can pretty much be interested in anything as long as there's something to figure out. Right now I'm figuring out how to make Guidelighter great for you.
